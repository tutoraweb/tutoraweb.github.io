Hi there!

This is the first post of this blog, so there is not much to say.

Currently, Tutora supports visitor sign-in from the kiosk page. On
the back-end, most of the database tables and their queries are setup.
The majority of these queries and their functions in code are unit-tested.

Coming up next, is visitor sign-out from the kiosk page and the tutor
feedback workflow, where a visitor can leave feedback for more than
one tutors (heard that Tutortrac?).

After the above are implemented and thoroughly tested, I will setup
the login page and work on the admin workflows.

Wish me luck!
