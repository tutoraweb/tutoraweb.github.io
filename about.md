Hello there! I am Serapheim Dimitropoulos and this is a blog that is
specific to Tutora. Tutora is one of my most ambitious projects and
since it might have actual users someday I thought it was proper to
make a blog for it.

### About Tutora

Have you ever heard of Tutortrac? If not the checkout [this link][tut].
I have been a tutor at an institution called [ARC][arc] for some time now
and I have used Tutortrac as a student, tutor and admin. As a
young programmer I think I can do better. If I were to put the goal
of this project in one sentence it would be the following:

**Tutora aims to provide a free and better alternative to Tutortrac.**

### About this blog

In this blog I will be posting development updates and version
releases of Tutora. If you have any questions please check the
FAQ of this blog first before emailing me any questions. This
blog does not support comments so if you are interested in
Tutora or have any feedback, please email me at
serapheimd [at] gmail [dot] com.
