What is Tutora?
: Look at the **About** page. 

Why are you doing this?
: The main reasons are annoyance, experience and love. Annoyance because Tutortrac has a counter-intuitive UI, lacks some features and it is overall a buggy system. Experience because I want to explore new technologies, see how it is to drive a fairly complex project by myself and of course the possibility of communicating with users that actually use my software. Love because I just love programming.

So you are doing all this for free?
: Tutora is free for you to grab and use! I will try my best to make it bug-free and cool enough for you to use for free. I am planning to set up a system to accept donations but I highly doubt that anyone will be interested in that. If I get any actual users I might put a price for providing support but the development of Tutora and the platform itself will be free for you to download and use.

What if I just steal your code?
: Well it depends how you define stealing. If you mean copying it, modifying it to suit your purpose and even make money out of it, you are free to do that under the condition that you comply with the Mozilla Public License 2.0 . That basically means that you would need to have the majority of my source code that you copied availiable to the public Internet. In the case that you copy the code and you do not disclose its parts and/or you delete its License and copyright notice, you invalidate the aforementioned license.

I found a bug! What can I do?
: Hurray! Please [submit a bug report](https://github.com/tutoraweb/tutora/issues/new). Try to be as detailed as possible and try to describe your process so I can reproduce the bug myself and tackle it. If you are not sure whether what you found is a bug or not please do not hesitate to raise an issue and submit it as a bug or email me first to make sure. It is better to be safe than sorry :-)

I have this cool idea for new a feature. Can I tell you about it?
: Sure! I would be more than happy to hear about it, so feel free to email me or submit your idea as a bug. Keep in mind, that my replies might be slow since I am only one person doing this. In addition, I tend to prioritize tackling bugs first and then implementing the usable features that Tutortrac provides. That means that if the feature that you suggest is not very cool or on-demand right now, it might stay at the backlog for some time.

You said I can download it and use it for free. Where are the binaries?
: I am only one guy and Tutora is in early development stages now. You can either wait or just download the source code and compile Tutora yourself.

I want to help you! What can I do?
: Thank you so much! All the help I can get is greatly appreciated. Just send me an email specifying the areas that you would like to contribute (code, documentation, manuals, marketing, donations ...etc) and I will get back to you ASAP.
